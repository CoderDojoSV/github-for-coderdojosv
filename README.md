GitHub for Coder Dojos
======================

[GitHub][] is a source code host and collaboration tool originally built for
programmers.  At our Coder Dojos, we use GitHub to design, build, and manage
our course curricula as well as our events and mentors. Since not every mentor
works with GitHub on a regular basis, this guide seeks to clarify the ways in
which we use 

Big Nouns on GitHub
-------------------

### Repository

A repository encapsulates a single project on GitHub. It contains the current
files and folders associated with the project as well as its complete history,
issues, pull requests, and in some cases a wiki. Each repository can be either
*public*, visible to everyone on the internet, or *private*, visible only to
logged in users with permission to view the repository.

### Issue

An issue usually describes a problem with a project. But we also use them to
ask questions, make suggestions, and foster discussion regarding the
repository.

### Fork

A fork of a repository is a copy on GitHub made for another user to push their
own changes, usually so they can be seen by the repository's owners and used
to create a pull request. Forks which exist solely on GitHub are distinct from
repository clones, which are created on your local computer.

### Pull Request

A pull request is a proposal to change the files in a repository. Usually pull
requests fix bugs or suggest improvements.

### Organization

An organization on GitHub is an account managed by multiple individuals that
has its own repositories and teams separate from the individuals.
[CoderDojoSV][] is an organization on GitHub which houses repositories related
to the operation of our dojos.

### Team

more terms explained.
